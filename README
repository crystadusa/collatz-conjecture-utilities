# Crystadusa's collatz conjecture utilities
### About
This repository is where I plan to store and update and coding endeavers invoving the [collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). As of now, this binary can determine if a range of numbers go below themselves in the conjecture with multi threading and configuration for [precomputation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#Optimizations).

### Command line syntax
collatz \<End\> \<Options\>  
collatz \<Start\> \<End\> \<Options\>

Options:
* -c -const-steps \<Precomputed steps per iteration\>
* -m -mod-steps \<Precomputed steps for modular skip\>
* -t -threads \<Number of Threads\>

### Build
This project is simply built with "cargo build --release".
